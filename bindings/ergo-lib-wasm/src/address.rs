//! Address types

/**
 * An address is a short string corresponding to some script used to protect a box. Unlike (string-encoded) binary
 * representation of a script, an address has some useful characteristics:
 *
 * - Integrity of an address could be checked., as it is incorporating a checksum.
 * - A prefix of address is showing network and an address type.
 * - An address is using an encoding (namely, Base58) which is avoiding similarly l0Oking characters, friendly to
 * double-clicking and line-breaking in emails.
 *
 *
 *
 * An address is encoding network type, address type, checksum, and enough information to watch for a particular scripts.
 *
 * Possible network types are:
 * Mainnet - 0x00
 * Testnet - 0x10
 *
 * For an address type, we form content bytes as follows:
 *
 * P2PK - serialized (compressed) public key
 * P2SH - first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of serialized script bytes
 * P2S  - serialized script
 *
 * Address examples for testnet:
 *
 * 3   - P2PK (3WvsT2Gm4EpsM9Pg18PdY6XyhNNMqXDsvJTbbf6ihLvAmSb7u5RN)
 * ?   - P2SH (rbcrmKEYduUvADj9Ts3dSVSG27h54pgrq5fPuwB)
 * ?   - P2S (Ms7smJwLGbUAjuWQ)
 *
 * for mainnet:
 *
 * 9  - P2PK (9fRAWhdxEsTcdb8PhGNrZfwqa65zfkuYHAMmkQLcic1gdLSV5vA)
 * ?  - P2SH (8UApt8czfFVuTgQmMwtsRBZ4nfWquNiSwCWUjMg)
 * ?  - P2S (4MQyML64GnzMxZgm, BxKBaHkvrTvLZrDcZjcsxsF7aSsrN73ijeFZXtbj4CXZHHcvBtqSxQ)
 *
 *
 * Prefix byte = network type + address type
 *
 * checksum = blake2b256(prefix byte ++ content bytes)
 *
 * address = prefix byte ++ content bytes ++ checksum
